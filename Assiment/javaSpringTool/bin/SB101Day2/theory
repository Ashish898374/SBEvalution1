Method Reference:
Explain:Java provides a new feature called method reference in Java 8. Method reference is used to refer method
of functional interface. It is compact and easy form of lambda expression.
Instead of creating a Lambda Expression with all the details, with the help of method reference we can
refer an existing class method to the functional interface implementation, which matches the condition of
Lambda Expression.
Types of Method References:
There are following types of method references in java:
1. Reference to a static method.
2. Reference to an instance (non-static) method.
3. Reference to a constructor.



Example :
    @FunctionalInterface
interface apna{
void sayHello(String name);
}
public class Main {
public static void fun1(String s){
System.out.println("Using static Method reference Welcome "+s);
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
apna i1 = Main::fun1;
i1.sayHello("welcome");
}
}
