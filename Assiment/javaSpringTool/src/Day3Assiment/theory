Functional interface in java->

An interface which has only one abstract method is called as functional interface.
This functional interface can have any number of default, static methods, but can contains only one
abstract method.
A functional interface can have methods of the Object class also.
Functional Interface is also known as Single Abstract Method Interfaces or SAM Interfaces. It is a
new feature in Java 8,

example:




      @FunctionalInterface
interface first{
void sayHello(String name);    // i can say Functional method because only one method abstract method there are no any static and default
             // method only one abstract method auto maticaly;
}
class X implements first{
public void sayHello(String name){
System.out.println("Welcome "+name);
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
first i1 = new X();
i1.sayHello("functional method");
}
};
