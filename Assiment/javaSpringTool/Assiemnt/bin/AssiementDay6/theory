SYNCHRONIZED METHOD =  for synchronized method the lock will be held throught the method while in syncronized block the lock 
held only the block scope
sysncrpnized method lock on object instanc the method in contained in the while a syncronized block can lock any object;



SYNCRONIZED BLOCK=  syncronized block previes any mode control over lock as you can use any lock to provides mutual
excution to criticals section code syncronized method always lock either current object and class level lock  if its static syncronized 
method  
Note= class level block is use to  static method
object level block is use to non static method 


sysncronized block mean
sysncronized(this){
insode the code here 

}
syncronized method=
 public synscronized void function(){
 inside the code here
 }

 
 
 
 RACE CONDITION= race condition are execute multithreading and some time run the code change the data race is critical condition
 some class but incrroct behavior of codee, if thread A is reading data from the linked list and another thread B is trying to delete the same data.
This process leads to a race condition that may result in run time error


EXAMPLE=
class local{
public void fun1(Stirng name){
System.out.print("Welcome to start local class");
try{
Thread.sleep(1000);
}
catch(Exception e){
}
System.out.println(name);
}



class ThreadA extends Thread{
local l;
String name;
public ThreadA(local l,String name) {
this.l=l;
this.name=name;
}
@Override
public void run() {
l.fun1(name);
}
}


class ThreadB extends Thread{
local l;
String name;
public ThreadB(local l,String name) {
this.l=l;
this.name=name;
}
@Override
public void run() {
l.fun1(name);
}
}




class Main{
public static void main(String[] args){
local l=new local();
// call the local class 
ThreadA t1=new ThreadA(l,"swanand");  // Arjun and swanand will not run because syncronized class use here 
ThreadB t2=new ThreadB(l,"Arjun");
t1.start()
t2.start();
}
}


SLEEP= sleep used to put a thread into temperery waiting state mean some time for class stop then will be run  

JOIN= join method used to put the parent thread in temperery waiting state till the completion  child of theory main class waiting  
all child class run after main class execute
